# Android Inc

Android is somewhat different from other mobile platforms and to get an idea of that difference we are going to take a trip into history.

## Danger Inc

The myth is that Nokia came up with the Smartphone term due to its devices having incorporated a broswer. That is really not the case.

Danger in the early 2000s came out with a device called SideKick that had client-cloud services. And the device took off with young consumers.

## Establishment of Android Inc.

At the time Andy Rubin with several others was incubating the idea of what if a Smartphone was thsi device that was connected to cloud services, knew its location, and knew its owners preferences in addition to having a web browser.  Android Inc formed in Android Inc in fall of 2003 with Rich Miner(co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.), Nick Sears(once Vpat T-mobile), and Chris White(headed design and interface development at webTv).

In Mid-2005, Google purchased Android INC. At that point some of the components of the Linux Kernel and Userland werein-place but no UI and AppFrameework was in-place on top of that kernel.

## Google, Anddroid Division Early Years

Google set about to polish the Linxu Kernel and Userland combination that Android Inc competed and to put some type of UI and App framework ontop of that base foundation. It was at this time that the decision was made to creare a java Virtual Machine to allow developers to develop apps using the java language.

## Open Handset Alliance

In 2007 Google with devide manufacturers and wireless catriers establishd the open Handset Alliance to help establish standards for android devices. Members of this alliance get early preivews  of next android releases so that they can prepare such OS versions 
for their next upcoming devices.

## First Android Launch

HTC launched the HTC Dream in the fall of 2008 running Android 1.0. Unlike a the prototype Sonner device it had a real touch screen and a sliding physcial keyboard.
